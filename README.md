# 🧠 Skill Advisor - Job Role Recommendation System

This is a beginner-friendly **Generative AI-based Python mini project** that helps users get **job role suggestions** based on their entered skills.

## 🔍 How It Works?

- User enters a job role (e.g., "AI Engineer").
- User provides skills (comma-separated like: `python, tensorflow, pandas`).
- The system checks:
  - If skills match that job role → ✅ Recommends the role.
  - If not → ❌ Suggests better matched roles using given skills.
